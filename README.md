# ToDo-List
Introduction:-  To design and develop a ToDo List website where users can seamlessly manage their tasks. From adding new tasks to editing and deleting existing ones, every aspect was meticulously crafted to enhance the user experience.

🔍 Key Features:

Task Management: Users can effortlessly add, edit, delete, and mark tasks as completed or uncompleted.

Local Storage: Say goodbye to lost tasks! The application stores tasks locally, ensuring they persist even after a browser refresh.

User Interface: With a focus on user experience, I dedicated time to refining the interface for maximum intuitiveness and ease of use.

✅ Requirements and Testing:

I implemented the core functionality using JavaScript to ensure a seamless user experience.
The application is not only functional but also responsive and visually appealing across different devices.
Extensive testing was conducted to guarantee that the app functions flawlessly and meets user expectations.
I'm incredibly proud of the outcome of this project and excited to share it with you! Stay tuned for more updates and insights from my journey in web development. 💻💬
